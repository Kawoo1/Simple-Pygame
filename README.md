# Simple-Pygame

A small individual coding project used to familiarize and illustrate "pygame", which is a set of python modules that is built on Simple DirectMedia (SDL) and provides low level access to computer hardware like audio, keyboard, and mouse allowing for game design,
This small demonstration creates a 900 x 600 pixel window and a rectangle character moveable within. There are no enemies, or objectives. This is a rudimentary framework designed to exercise pygame potential.

The Rectangle is a nice hue of blue.
